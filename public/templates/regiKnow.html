				<strong>
					REGIKNOW
				</strong> is a question based social application, allowing users to ask and answer questions, as well as acknowledge the value of users' responses.
				<br>
				My role was <i>Front-End Lead</i> while working with a group of 3 other developers to build application within a period of 3 weeks. Although I focused on the front-end functionality, UI, and design, I also assisted with back-end components like connecting our photo upload API and implementing AJAX calls to get/connect data from the database.
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Built with the MEAN stack using the following:</strong>
				<br> 
				HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AngularJS, Angular Material, Node.js, Nodemailer, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Google APIs, Cloudinary, and Passport.js.
